<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>Here I propose a framework for a non-liberal, non-radical, and non-transmisogynistic feminism: a proletarian feminism. This work builds upon a materialist analysis of <a href="http://anti-imperialism.com/2014/02/24/on-the-social-construction-of-sex-part-1/">sex as a social construct</a> (more available <a href="http://alyx.io/educational-resources/trans/#sex-binary">here</a>), which is essential reading before you continue. For those unaware of dialectics some parts of this essay may be hard to follow, so I recommend reading an <a href="http://anti-imperialism.com/2013/12/24/a-short-primer-on-dialectics/">introduction</a> if you haven’t encountered this concept before.</p>

<h3 id="the-basis-of-sexism">The Basis of Sexism</h3>

<p>Modern radical feminist thought can be summed up as arising from this basic premise:<sup id="fnref:radfeminism"><a href="#fn:radfeminism" class="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Patriarchy is a caste system which takes humans who are born biologically male or female and turns them into the social classes called men and women.
<small><a href="http://www.deepgreenresistance.org/en/who-we-are/radical-feminism-faqs">Deep Green Resistance</a></small></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Instead, sex and gender exist in a dialectical relationship. Although he made no conceptual distinction between sex and gender, Engels in <em>The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State</em> summed up the development of patriarchy roughly as follows:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Agriculture was invented,</li>
  <li>which lead to the development of a surplus,</li>
  <li>enabling some to live off the labour of others,</li>
  <li>leading to the development of class society.</li>
  <li>Class society necessitates that lines of inheritance be identified and secured,</li>
  <li>leading to sexual control of those capable of pregnancy.</li>
</ol>

<p>I would add a seventh point onto this:</p>

<ol start="7">
	<li>
		this necessitated a socially constructed category ("sex") to arise, seperating:
		<ul>
			<li>those who were able to become pregnant</li>
			<li>from those who couldn't become pregnant</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ol>

<p>Some may object to Engels’ conclusion, stating that “even in pre-class societies gender [roles] still existed”, but this argument makes the mistake of falsely projecting current social relations into the past. There was a fuzzy and inexact “division of labour” (in the hunting/gathering sense) based on physical fitness and capability, and so it follows that the share of work would have fallen <em>very</em> roughly and haphazardly along the lines of what we’d <em>now</em> call “gender” in our current social context, but this was nothing like gender roles or gendered oppression, and didn’t constitute a category of domination or exploitation. Pre-class societies, having no surplus, required that everyone work exactly or near-exactly according to their physical capabilities because there simply wasn’t the productive capacity to allow for the inefficiency of gender roles caused by sex classifications.</p>

<p>What of gender, then? Where does it fit into these seven points?</p>

<p>There was a qualitative shift in the development of sex relations; patriarchy transcended and shifted from its original solely sex-based form into a sex and gender-based one. Class society caused sex, and sex in turn caused gender. “Gender” is when sexism, oppression and exploitation based on reproduction (and ultimately relations of production), is institutionalized and divorced from each individual person’s reproductive capacity and general biology.</p>

<p>Without sex, sexism wouldn’t have ever arisen, but an individual person’s “sex”, as decided by society, doesn’t completely determine their relationship to sexism. Designation at birth isn’t some metaphysical essence that’s imparted on someone for life, entirely and necessarily coloring all further social interactions. Designation at birth is of course an incredibly powerful predictor of the ensuing privileges, socialization, and sex education society places upon someone, and this absolutely cannot be denied. But as ever, as with all generalisations, it isn’t correct in every case.</p>

<p>Confusion of the conditions for the creation and development of oppressor and oppressed classes with the conditions for oppression in a mostly individual context is one of the most infuriating aspects of radical feminism. The categories of “<abbr title="Designated Female At Birth">DFAB</abbr>” and “<abbr title="Designated Male At Birth">DMAB</abbr>” developed in tandem with the development of the gender hierarchy, but that doesn’t mean that each individual person’s place in the gender hierarchy is necessarily what one would traditionally expect for a person of their birth designation. To think otherwise is a classic misunderstanding of the relationship between the aggregate and the particular.</p>

<p>Whether you’re a trans woman or a cis woman – at least on the surface – doesn’t matter to those enforcing patriarchy. Even those trans women gendered as “freaks” or “gender traitor men” and not “cis woman” still receive womanhood, maybe not always as a label, but certainly on the end of male violence.</p>

<p>The categories of “womanhood” and “manhood” weren’t created for anything, they weren’t created <em>specifically</em> and with some sort of supernatural intent to oppress the categories of “female” and “male”, as some propose. Those concepts weren’t brought into existence by anything sentient, there’s no real mystical “purpose” to them. Manhood is imposed (or granted) on the oppressor class, and womanhood (or “<a href="https://radtransfem.wordpress.com/2011/12/12/genderternary-transmisogyny/">genderfreakhood</a>” for trans women sometimes) imposed on the oppressed class. That’s really all there is to it.</p>

<p>Taking the above radical feminist quote and expanding and adapting it in light of our proletarian feminist understanding, we get:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Patriarchy is a caste system arising from class society. Class society created the social construct of “sex”, which in turn paved way for the social construct of “gender”. Gender turns humans, broadly, into the social classes “woman” and “man”, these classes are <em>structurally</em> (not individually) dependent on the social classes “female” and “male”.</p>

  <p>The sex categories of today and of past class societies would not exist outside of their respective relations of production. Just like it’s exploitation that creates gender and not the contrary, it’s exploitation that creates sex, and not the contrary. The contrary would be to say that sex creates exploitation – to say that the origin of exploitation lies in sex itself – in a natural division of humanity outside of society.</p>

  <p>Ultimately, women’s role in society stems from class society, not biology. It is only when biology enters into a social relationship with class society and the social construct of “sex” arises that women are controlled. Without women, there would be no heirs, and without heirs no inherited property or lines of class succession. The category of sex is the product of class society in which men colonize as property the reproduction of women, just as as animals, peoples, nations, lands, and natural resources were colonized.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="gender-identity">Gender Identity</h3>

<p>There are three sites of contradiction within the concept of “gender identity” for trans people:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>self↔body:</strong> private feelings about body – “this body shape feels personally wrong to me.”</li>
  <li><strong>self↔society:</strong> social feelings about gendered relationships – “this gender role feels wrong to me.”, “people gendering me this way feels wrong to me.”</li>
  <li><strong>society↔body:</strong> social feelings about body – “this body makes people think I’m $gender.”, “I’m uncomfortable with the social meaning attached to this body”</li>
</ul>

<p>These three relationships are, in turn, dialectically related to one another.</p>

<p>Internal quantitative change in some combination of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the attitudes of society,</li>
  <li>the morphology of the body,</li>
  <li>or the personality or personal circumstances of the trans person,</li>
</ul>

<p>drives an external, qualitative, change in a relationship, and is characterized by temporary bouts of self-doubt or dysphoria. This moves in a spiral pattern, with the contradictions getting ever sharper, until the person comes out. No one will experience this process exactly alike, and the principle contradictions will be different for everyone.</p>

<p>The prevailing notion – at least in liberal feminism – that dysphoria causes transness is wholly wrong. An equally wrong idea, popular for radical feminists, is the view that transness causes dysphoria. There’s no one-way causal relationship; instead, they co-emerge. They’re in a feedback loop, forever remaking, reforging, and reshaping each other. Utterly inseparable, yet distinct at the same time. The spiral metaphor applies very aptly here as well.</p>

<h4 id="how-are-these-contradictions-resolved">How are these contradictions resolved?</h4>

<p>The <em>self↔body</em> contradiction can be resolved by HRT and surgery. This is also true, though maybe to a lesser degree (and also depending on luck), for <em>society↔body</em>. Activism or revolution can resolve <em>society↔body</em>, and <em>self↔society</em>.</p>

<p>These three points, self, body, society, are all intimately interconnected, changing one changes the other, and none can be considered static or immalleable.</p>

<h4 id="how-does-this-inform-our-practice">How does this inform our practice?</h4>

<p>This leads to the conclusion that trans people aren’t <em>just</em> the product of a gendered society, that a contradiction between self and body can exist in any society, but that it doesn’t make sense to talk about <em>self↔body</em> without also talking about <em>society↔body</em>.</p>

<p>We should thoroughly reject the chauvinist practices of both liberal and radical feminism, and instead adopt a praxis informed by a nuanced, dialectical view of the world.</p>

<p>The common line from trans activists that trans people’s gender is entirely uninfluenced by gender roles is just as a ridiculous proposition as the converse line from radical feminists, that trans people’s gender is entirely influenced by gender roles. In actuality, gender roles are going to have a differing effect based on the social, historical, and individual context of the person in question.</p>

<p>We should staunchly combat the reactionary subsections of the trans population <em>overtly</em> influenced by gender roles in their decision to transition as this only serves to reinforce gender roles and provide a smaller space in which “womanhood” or “manhood” can reside. Radical feminists rightly criticize this to some degree but draw the wrong conclusions, and liberal feminists fail to engage with this at all. We must be very careful in our own criticisms here, however, as some people take any trans woman’s display of femininity – regardless of the reasons – as automatically illegitimate, as a sign that they’re “faking” or “appropriating” womanhood, or that they’re some sort of drag queen.</p>

<p>We should wholly reject the biological-essentialist “brain sex” framework that liberal feminists cozy up to, but radical feminists rightly oppose.</p>

<p>We should wholly reject the notions of a hard divide between cis and trans people. It’s both theoretically and experientially unsound. A recent study<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">2</a></sup> found that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>About 33% of men and 38% of women felt both as a man and as a woman</li>
  <li>About 30% of men and 45% of women expressed a dislike of their sexed body</li>
  <li>41% of men and 46.8% of women experience themselves to some extent as two genders</li>
  <li>36.6% of the [non-trans] subjects reported that they sometimes feel like the ‘other’ gender</li>
  <li>63.7% reported that they sometimes wish to be the ‘other’ gender</li>
  <li>41.9% were sometimes discontent with their sexed body</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="privilege">Privilege</h3>

<p>The notion that trans women have male privilege is laughable, and oft-times astoundingly hypocritical. Why do we never hear anything about the “straight privilege” of non-trans queers? Why is “raised heterosexual” a term never to grace the lips of anyone discussing non-trans queers? Why are people quick to the draw with “socialized [fe]male” but not “socialized cis”?</p>

<p>Everyone in the world is presented with ideas about womanhood and manhood, maleness and femaleness, regardless of – but of course varying in concordance with – their birth designation. Radical feminists have the direction of causality mixed up, it’s not that your sex completely determines your socialization, it’s that socialization is partly determined by sex designation at birth. People aren’t so much socialized <em>into</em> a gender role, but educated about gender role<em>s</em>, plural.</p>

<p>Ordered by increasing importance, we can break down the factors needed (in some combination) for someone to have male privilege:</p>

<ul>
  <li>education about gender roles through the male lens</li>
  <li>acting out male gender roles</li>
  <li>internalization of male gender roles</li>
  <li>being granted the male gender role by others</li>
</ul>

<p>These four points can be further split into three distinct periods:</p>

<ul>
  <li>pre-everything</li>
  <li>post-coming-out to yourself</li>
  <li>post-coming-out to the world</li>
</ul>

<p>A trans woman on coming out to herself soon drops internalized male privilege and starts to internalize female gender roles. On coming out to the world, she very quickly leaves behind the last point of the first list, the male role granted by others onto her.</p>

<p>Some trans women may find themselves subconsciously identifying to some degree with women before they come out to themselves. Once a trans woman comes out to herself she’ll very quickly feel like an imposter, she’ll be scared that she’ll be found out at any moment, that she’ll be identified as a gender traitor. Someone thought by others to be something they’re not is never going to fully exercise the privileges granted onto that group.</p>

<p>Trans women may have experienced limited aspects of male privilege in the past, but once she starts living life as a trans woman most of the time these quickly become overshadowed by her new experiences and socialization, leaving in any relevance only the knowledge of how men talk and act when they think no women are around. Trans women after coming out face much worse (on average) daily material circumstances and much more extreme degrees of misogyny than cis women generally receive,<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">3</a></sup> doing a great job of nullifying past experiences.</p>

<p>Anyone active in the trans community long enough will have heard horror stories about older transitioners, and if we absolutely must talk about trans women having male privilege, it’s probably them. I suspect that older transitioners will have experienced the four points in my privilege dissection for long enough in the pre-everything period such that – maybe at least initially – those years stand a much greater chance of overshadowing the post-transition period.</p>

<p>But what does this simplistic view of socialization and male privilege mean for feminist praxis in general? A feminist praxis stuck in the rut of socialization mythology is an unscientific and dogmatic one unable to correctly respond to changing circumstances. There’s no such thing as a universal female socialization. Female socialization will always be tempered by the ever different material circumstances. In fact, it’s the patriarchs who’d ideally have us receive something approaching a universal socialization. If the feminist movement is to accept the myth of universal female socialization it means, by default, universalizing the socialization of the most privileged subsections of women, it means ignoring the differing socialization of all intersectionally oppressed women, not just trans women.</p>

<h3 id="gender-role-conformity">Gender Role Conformity</h3>

<p>Some trans people suddenly conforming to gender stereotypes after transition isn’t terribly surprising given the unavoidable sexism and cissexism in this society. The impossibly inhuman digitally-manipulated model with a clothing size of “negative-five” isn’t a standard that trans people are mystically exempt from. Some may start to conform in an attempt to justify their transness and legitimize or rationalize their gender, not only to themselves but to others as well. Others, especially trans women and those who also face transmisogyny, may even consciously choose to conform to some degree.</p>

<p>If a trans woman chooses to wear a dress instead of a t-shirt and jeans so that she might stand a better chance of appearing normative and gaining conditional cis privilege, can you really wholly blame her for that instance of conformance? Street harassment, violence, housing and employment discrimination, sexual assault, rape, and more, are the daily lives of “non-passing” <abbr title="Coercively Assigned Male At Birth">CAMAB</abbr> people.</p>

<p>I can personally attest to this. The fundamentals of my wardrobe haven’t altered, I’m still a hoodie, jeans, and t-shirt kind of person. The only thing that’s changed since I came out is the fit and cut of the clothing I choose to wear to avoid getting misgendered or placed as trans.</p>

<p>Capitulation with the more “institutional” axis of oppression to save oneself from the more “individual” axis of oppression is hardly a phenomenon unique to trans people; let’s not forget that cis people also face pressure to mold themselves into gender stereotypes. Women wear makeup, black people straighten their hair, autistic people hide their stimming, queer couples avoid holding hands on the street. These specific examples of conformance aren’t even generally in the same league as trans people’s, as succumbence doesn’t usually deny them absolutely vital medical care.</p>

<p>The aim is to help trans people overcome these sorts of pressures, not punish them for it, and certainly not automatically use it as an excuse to discredit trans people as a whole. There’s no arduous “real life experience” test from a board-certified “homothesiologist” that non-trans queers have to go through to get recognition as queer, but every step of the way, from siblings, parents, friends, doctors, counselors, psychologists, the whole gamut, every single minutiae of trans people’s lives are scrutinized. There’s an eternal and grueling game of Spot The Difference, a hopelessly idealized gender role on the left and the trans person on the right.</p>

<h3 id="dysphoria">Dysphoria</h3>

<p>We should wholly reject the notion that HRT and surgery are the only possible cures. There’s sickness to be found in society, but expecting – nay, demanding through denial of other options – trans people to solely resign themselves to changing society, as radical feminists are tend to do, is nothing but cruel. Liberal feminists – and you may be noticing a pattern here – enact another cruelty (though thankfully less severe) when they dismiss non-medical cures for dysphoria. What are we to do with the people who have had access to HRT and surgery but still feel dysphoria? Should we not be investigating ways to help them with that instead of leaving them high and dry?</p>

<p>A common argument is that transness is innate because years, and many different types, of psychological therapy have yet to produce a cure for gender dysphoria that isn’t transition of some sort. I don’t think this holds water, however, if you consider the fact that that psychologists at large will be coming from the perspective of society at large: a patriarchal, and thus wrong, perspective.</p>

<p>I don’t feel comfortable stating that psychological therapy has been proven not to work as long as psychologists in general don’t correctly understand gender dynamics and sociology, as long as they don’t incorporate feminist analysis. I do, however, very much understand the allure of denying any possible non-medical dysphoria treatment, since the denial of medical treatment is an incredibly important issue for the trans community.</p>

<p>It would be a terribly callous mistake to descend into some sort of “everything has some truth to it” depravity, but at this point in time, it’s scientifically untenuous to firmly propose the irrelevance of some sort or manner of psychiatric intervention at this stage of society.</p>

<h3 id="gender">Gender</h3>

<p>Womanhood and manhood are defined by their existence <em>through each other</em> and their violent struggle <em>against one another</em>. You can’t have one without the other, a contradiction (and an antagonistic one at that) in dialectics parlance. One is the struggle of the oppressed and one the struggle of the oppressor. The call for the abolishment of gender isn’t quite correct, or at least requires a bit more nuance and elaboration. Women and men are not the problem, to be abolished on equal terms, it’s men who are the main problem. That’s where we need to focus our energy. You don’t abolish classes by trying to abolish the proletariat and the bourgeoisie both together, no, you focus on the bourgeoisie. You focus on the exploiters and the dominant class in the dialectic – you abolish men first and foremost.</p>

<p>The only progressive way forward for men is for them to strive to end class society – the conditions which gave rise to gender – and to give up manhood, to abdicate their patriarchal throne. To consciously decide to fight sexism at every opportunity and to politically, materially, and ideologically, disassociate as much as possible from their privileged position, masculinity, and exploitation of women. To try and undermine their own social position at every turn. Progressive men should stop trying to envision a “better” manhood or a “better” masculinity; men hurt themselves, other men, women, and non-men when they assert their masculinity, and they should stop trying to imagine ways to redeem themselves without fundamental change.</p>

<p>Just like I strive to give up and end my position and the category of first world labour aristocrat, my position of whiteness, and my position of physical abledness, I call on men to strive to give up manhood. It doesn’t mean I shrug off the label “white” or “labour aristocrat”, just the positioning of those identities as good, or at worst neutral. It means that I recognise that they are fundamentally oppressive social positions and that the only possible use for them are as political organizing labels and for the recognition of my own privilege.</p>

<p>When I say “I’m a woman” I’m not saying I innately “feel or identify like a woman” (I don’t think you can ever construct a non-patriarchal justification for that), I’m instead relating myself to other women and our somewhat shared experience as a group under patriarchy. I’m stating that my material interests and experience of the world are mostly aligned with womanhood, that my liberation is therefore fundamentally and intimately bound up with other women, and thus as far as I’m concerned, “woman” generally describes me.</p>

<p>I “identify” with womanhood because it describes my political experience. It’s the category, or near enough (“genderfreakhood” is also pertinent), that is imposed on me. When I’m gendered woman, I am woman. When I’m not gendered woman, I’m not woman. Like the other oppressive social constructs – blackness or queerness for example – “identification” with them for this reason isn’t reification, but a recognition of the political and social reality of other’s reification of the concept.</p>

<p>My birth designation doesn’t matter. When I’m walking down the street, people gender me as “not male”, as a woman, and it makes me uneasy. When people spew biotruths or make sexist jokes, I know it’s aimed at me. When I see women objectified over and over and over again, I can’t help but learn to hate myself. When I hear about rampant rape, sexual assault, and general violence, I wonder, might I become one of those statistics? Even before I transitioned and started changing my body, the sexism I encountered was still generally aimed at people of a body type I needed for my health. Whenever I interact with a man there’s always a nagging in the back of my mind, how are gender relations coloring this interaction? Again and again, I constantly face misogyny – I face a form of womanhood.</p>

<h3 id="feminism">Feminism</h3>

<p>With all you’ve read here, I hope you’ll agree with my analysis that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Liberal feminism holds a metaphysical conception of both gender and sex</li>
  <li>Radical feminism holds a metaphysical conception of sex and a quasi-materialist and reductionist view of gender</li>
</ul>

<p>I use “metaphysical” here to mean an analysis that places gender or sex as “natural and inevitable truths”, as a prioris. As something essentially static and existing above or outside history and society. This means regarding sex or gender as anything other than social constructs.</p>

<p>I use “quasi-materialist and reductionist” here to mean an analysis that considers gender solely on it’s own terms, largely uninfluenced by other concerns. This means, for radical feminists, correctly identifying it as a social construct, but failing to properly situate gendered oppression within the context of class society.</p>

<p>Liberal feminism finds no problem incorporating trans people into its philosophy as there are no constraints from being fundamentally disengaged with reality. Liberal feminists make an effort to appear trans-inclusive (and most often only to score points against radical feminism in a sort of spiteful or superficial inclusion-theater) by erasing and writing off the influence and role of biology and “sex” in the development and functioning of patriarchy, with obvious theoretical and practical failures, and thus misogynistic consequences.</p>

<p>Radical feminism is a more interesting case. The combination of metaphysical and quasi-materialist views of sex and gender respectively produces transmisogyny. There is no saving or redeeming radical feminism of this as some have tried to do. It’s at the very core, the chauvinism is inescapable.</p>

<p>At the heart of radical feminist attacks on trans people is the notion of biological determinism. If the category of “women” is solely based on biology and women are oppressed specifically because of their reproductive organs, rather than a much deeper interplay between biology and the social-economic context, then trans women are natural enemies on the same level as men.</p>

<p>Radical feminists have successfully flipped the script, erasing their own essentialism, instead making it appear as if they are the ones valiantly battling against another kind of gender essentialism, one that trans people are automatically and always enforcing. They sing the same melody to a different tune. When they argue that trans people reinforce biological determinism, they avoid the question that if gender is a social construct, why can’t the gender one receives from society change?</p>

<p>Radical feminists contradict their desire to abolish gender when they claim that trans women can’t be “legitimate women” because they don’t know what it means to be oppressed as “real biological women”, essentialising the very category they decry others for essentialising! Trans women experience the very real pressures of sexism every day of their lives, and no amount of sophistry can change this.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>Eliminate liberal feminism!</p>

<p>Extinguish radical feminism!</p>

<p>Exterminate misogyny and transmisogyny!</p>

<p>Eradicate men!</p>

<p><strong>Long live proletarian feminism!</strong></p>
