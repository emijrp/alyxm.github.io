Gender is a construct of the <em>private home</em>, of the confines of the bedroom and the kitchen. It’s the construct of <em>intimacy</em>. It’s the construct that must invest in drawing up personal barriers due to the relative impossibility of more traditional barriers. It’s the construct that, by necessity – due to the closeness between “husband and wife” within the private household – creates the most deeply held personal ideology.</p><p>Class and national oppression are reproduced at a relative distance. The bourgeoisie, the whites, they don’t have as much contact – certainly not as much contact of the intimate kind – with the groups lower on the hierarchy. It is easy to enforce “racial” distinctions without resorting to individual ideology and personal identity as much, because these distinctions are generally enforced across borders – across entire communities, regions, or nations. There is a comparatively clear-cut separation. Entire families are usually racialized the same way, and in the private sphere there isn’t much “mixing” between “races”.</p><p>If we imagine a society where the bourgeoisie mixes socially, sexually, personally (and in every other kind of intimate manner) with the proletariat in perfect proportion to the percentage of the population they make up, then this society would be a very different society from our current reality. In our society, the bourgeois live in gated communities, in rich suburbs, or affluent postcodes. They inter-marry with other bourgeois, and create new bourgeois when they reproduce. Social mobility is a myth, class is semi-hereditary, and capitalism only slightly better than feudalism in this regard. Members of the bourgeoisie don’t have any intimate interaction with the members of the proletariat; if they are to get close and interact with the proletariat, then it isn’t the intimate kind of closeness like the closeness of the family. It’s the sort of closeness of a barked order, of a wage packet, of hiring or firing, of the ownership of the means of production that the proletariat operates.</p><p>Gender is another matter entirely. If we imagine a society where men mixed (in both intimate and non-intimate contexts) with women in perfect proportion to the percentage of the population that women make up, and <em>vise-versa</em>, then this society would not be too different from the one we live in. It is considered the ultimate destiny – the sole and divinely ordained purpose – of woman and man to join together, to become one, and create their own private sphere together. Gender isn’t hereditary like class and nation is since the husband and wife are tasked with the extension of themselves and their sphere through the production of new husbands and wives. Effectively, the family functions as a self-replicating unit, constructed from two people of radically different positions in the gender hierarchy, and tasked with the creation new people of differing positions in the very same hierarchy.</p><p>So if the division between husbands and wives (and the future husbands and wives they produce) in the family – and ultimately the division between woman and man – can’t be so overtly enforced at a relative distance like class and nation divisions are, then how is gender oppression propagated? What options gain increased importance due to the relative impossibility of others?</p><p>The intimacy requires, and enables, that the ratio of the “subjective-coercive” mechanism (coercion in the form of ideology) to the “objective-coercive” mechanism (coercion in the form of force, or the threat thereof; the standard definition of “coercion”) be much greater in gender than it is class or nation. Gender role education makes up one aspect of this “subjective-coercive” mechanism. But for the family unit to function as it currently does, it isn’t enough for the “different genders” to each receive their own specialized education. It needs to go further than that. These gender roles, once learned, must then be put into practice, and for this to happen as it currently does, we have the other aspect to the “subjective-coercive” mechanism: gender identity.</p><p>Both aspects heavily rely on each other to function and give each other meaning. Patriarchy needs us to believe that gender and gender roles are inherent to us so that we behave appropriately – not out of service to others, or because we were overtly coerced – but in service to ourselves and our natural inclinations and needs. We must be educated to want out of our own hearts, and to deeply <em>feel</em>, our gender (roles). Our genders and our selves are produced by society; patriarchy is the subject, gender is the verb, we’re the object, and gender identity is the result. For the oppressed to self-police, and really internalize their subjugated role, is a huge win for patriarchy. Likewise, for the oppressors to police themselves and the subjugated, and really internalize their subjugator role, is a huge win for patriarchy.</p><p>And, yes, let me make it absolutely clear that cis people gender identify just as much as trans people do. The <em>only</em> real difference between the two is that when trans people gender identify, it’s much more visible than when cis people do it. We must treat this fact very carefully. We need to figure out how to approach gender identity being bullshit without further marginalising trans people. Giving a proper answer to this question is outside the scope of this essay, but a <em>preliminary</em> answer is that it would generally be ultra-left (with rightist consequences, like all ultra-leftism) to start talking about gender identity being bullshit in everyday political contexts, given that cis people don’t view themselves as having gender identities, and so in their eyes this would be nothing but an attack on trans people.</p><p>If gender identity somehow didn’t exist as an aspect of patriarchy, then patriarchy wouldn’t be as strong. Removing gender identity, we have two options to keep the same level of patriarchy as before: decrease the level of intimacy, or increase the level of the “objective-coercive” mechanism. The relative amount of intimacy is fundamental to the arrangement of patriarchy, so the only thing left to do is to increase the relative amount of the “objective-coercive” mechanism, but an increase in this <em>couldn’t</em> happen with gender identity gone because it’s men who need to enforcing the violence (on a relatively intimate level, don’t forget!), and it’s gender identity that helps this happen in the first place.</p><p>For brievity, I’ll call the turning of gender into an identity, whether on a personal or a theoretical level, “the eroticisation of gender”. Liberal feminists exemplify the eroticisation of gender when they say that because “women identify as women” they are oppressed. As well as confusing up from down, symptom with cause, and basically mistaking the floor for the ceiling, this is an obvious idealist mistake because of the simple matter that if we waved a magic wand and made every woman in the world stop identifying as women, then patriarchy would not completely disappear! At least radical feminists, when they turn gender into biology, make some attempt at materialism and rising above the erotic by saying that because they “are born female” they are oppressed. They remain wrong, though.</p><p>Instead, I contend that it’s the oppression – the gendering that one receives from society – that makes the gender. “Woman” and “man” are scientific terms (or at least they should be), and gender is an objective process based on the interaction between reproduction in the abstract and class society, not an identity.</p><p>What does that mean concretely, though? If we also accept the fact that sex is a social construct and something that is not necessarily determinant of someone’s gender, but is an institutional basis for gender, then people – in some sense – can be a different gender moment to moment. When I’m having a butch day and I get gendered as male, am I a man at that moment in time, in that locality? To a degree, yes – that is the only non-erotic answer. There’s something to be said about socialization affecting my behavior (and then also other’s behavior towards me) regardless of the gendering I’m receiving in the moment, and the broader context of myself being gendered differently most of the time. But “man” is at least semi-applicable in contexts when I’m considered a man because that’s <em>the only thing that makes a man</em>.</p><p>As I’ve said earlier:</p><blockquote><p>When I say “I’m a woman” I’m not saying I innately “feel like a woman” (I don’t think you can ever construct a non-patriarchal justification for that), I’m instead relating myself to other women and our somewhat shared experience as a group under patriarchy. I’m stating that my material interests and experience of the world are aligned with womanhood; my liberation is therefore fundamentally and intimately bound up with other women, and thus as far as I’m concerned, “woman” describes me.<sup id="fnref:tpdsg"><a href="#fn:tpdsg" class="footnote">1</a></sup></p></blockquote><p>In western society, gender is <em>de jure</em> binary. This statement will raise no objections from anyone. What about <em>de facto</em>, though? If gender isn’t biology, <em>or</em> identity, then the only thing left that we can define gender with is “one’s relation to the gender heirarchy”. Based on this, it makes sense to say that western society is <em>de facto</em> a trigender society. What we have are “men”, “women”, and “gender outlaws”.</p><div class="thumbnail scale-image"> <a href="/images/2014-12-17-the-eroticisation-of-gender/gender.png" target="_blank"> <img src="/images/2014-12-17-the-eroticisation-of-gender/gender.png"/> </a></div><p><em>(Image credit: based on a sketch by Zoë Adams)</em></p><p>No one talks about the gender outlaws. You won’t find any official recognition of them, you won’t find a ‘☣’ symbol (or something) joining ‘F’ and ‘M’ in the list of valid birth certificate stamps. They’re the people that patriarchy has no use for, and doesn’t like to recognize: the outcasts, the “freaks”, the unintelligibles. If patriarchy does recognize them, then it’s an recognition of the threat they pose to the current order. Gender outlaws are the people who must be shoved back into one of the <em>de jure</em> positions: “housewife” or “lumberjack”, “male” or “female”. Failing this they must be exterminated.</p><p>A rough measure of how patriarchal a given society is can be found in the relative size of the “gender outlaw” gender versus officially sanctioned (<em>de jure</em>) genders (this won’t apply in all cases, but should be true in the aggregate). Less patriarchal societies quite often have more <em>de jure</em> genders than western society, and these additional genders might be imagined as replacing some or all of the space taken up by the “gender-outlaw” gender in the image above.</p><p>Trans women are perhaps the biggest gender outlaws. No one wastes any second of any day calling us “male”, yet neither do they ignore any chance to treat us as anything <em>but</em> men (very strong evidence pointing to the fact that sex is an institutional basis for gender). I think that the degree that each trans woman is “trans-gendered” by society is generally the degree that they are gendered “outlaws” by society. The trans women who face more transmisogyny (because they are perceived as more trans and less cis) are more “outlaws” and less “women” than the trans woman who faces a lower amount of transmisogyny. This also applies to the degree that one deviates from the cult of heterosexuality. Bisexual men are more gendered “outlaws” and less gendered “men” than hetero men. Lesbian women are more gendered “outlaws” and less gendered “women” than hetero women, and so on. Queer politics is the politics of the gender outlaws.</p><p>What about non-binary trans people, though? Where do they fit in this trigender model? What are they saying when they say that they are non-binary? What are they basing their statements on? What <em>can</em> they base them on? Are they saying it in recognition of the place that society has assigned them in the gender hierarchy? No, they’re saying that they are non-binary because they say they are non-binary, because they identify as non-binary and gender is a subjective phenomenon. In other words, gender eroticism. So if non-binary people are “non-binary”, it’s not because of their identity, but to the degree that they are placed outside of the binary by society (i.e., the degree to which they are gender outlaws).</p><p>Of course asserting an identity like “agender” can make one a target for being outlawed, but this doesn’t make “agender” really exist from a non-erotic point of view. I’m not trying to pick on non-binary people here though. It’s just that while the vast majority of people saying that they are “women” or “men” engage in just as much gender eroticism as non-binary people, “woman” and “man” coincidentally happen to exist from a hierarchical point of view, and by and large the people who identify as one of the binary genders also tend to actually be their gender from a non-erotic point of view.</p><p>Note that when we talk about “non-binary”, it would be eurocentric to attempt to apply that term to societies/contexts that have more than two (<em>de jure</em>) genders. “Non-binary” is only applicable to a binary society/context where there is a <em>de jure</em> binary to define itself against; it’s a relative term for a relative concept. If a given society had genders X, Y, and Z, then the equivalent term to “non-binary” in that society would be “non-trinary”. All three genders, X, Y, and Z would exist from a non-erotic point of view within that society, just because that’s how people in that society can get gendered, meaning that those genders are objective positions within the gender hierarchy of that society/context.</p><p>Ultimately, turning gender into a subjective matter, making it something based not on society but on oneself and one’s feelings, is nothing but misogyny. “Woman” and “man” are scientific terms, but when we eroticise gender we confuse this. We end up obscuring the functioning of patriarchy, naturalizing gender, and falling to decadent capitalist individualism. Eroticising gender inevitably leads to reformism because if gender is an identity, not something caused by patriarchy, then “gender is an inevitable occurrence because it must have existed before patriarchy”, and so the best we can do is “reform gender, rather than get rid of it”. To justify gender reformism, perhaps the most highly developed gender eroticist, Judith Butler, says:</p><blockquote><p>[G]ender can be very important to us, and some people really love the gender that they have claimed for themselves. If gender is eradicated, so too is an important domain of pleasure for many people. And others have a strong sense of self bound up with their genders, so to get rid of gender would be to shatter their self-hood.<sup id="fnref:jb-interview"><a href="#fn:jb-interview" class="footnote">2</a></sup></p></blockquote><p>Using pleasure as a metric for legitimacy under patriarchy is ceeding ground to patriarchy because patriarchy constructs pleasure in its own image. In the manufacturing of consent for patriarchy of the participants, patriarchy requires that women enjoy their own domination. Although most feminists don’t like to admit this, significant numbers – somewhere in the 31% and 57% range – of women have rape fantasies.<sup id="fnref:rape-fantasies"><a href="#fn:rape-fantasies" class="footnote">3</a></sup> They get themselves off on the idea of male ownership of their bodies. They treat perhaps the purest expression of patriarchy as pleasurable, as erotic, as a nice fuck. Why, then, should we be surprised when people treat gender itself as a nice fuck? When objects gendered by the patriarchal subject start enjoying their objectification (in both senses of the word), then that’s just how intimacy functions.</p><p>As MIM quite rightly pointed out:</p><blockquote><p>It’s not possible to say that women and men have had unequal power for centuries and then pretend that much of women’s behavior relative to men is not some kind of adjustment to that inequality.<sup id="fnref:mim-theory"><a href="#fn:mim-theory" class="footnote">4</a></sup></p></blockquote><p>In summary, and to switch up Beauvoir’s famous words: <strong>One is not born female or woman, nor does one identify as such, but rather, one becomes female and woman</strong>.</p><hr/><div class="footnotes"><ol><li id="fn:tpdsg"><p><a href="https://alyx.io/feminism/2014/05/24/trans-people-and-dialectics-of-sex-and-gender/">Trans People and the Dialectics of Sex and Gender: Against Radical and Liberal Feminism</a> <a href="#fnref:tpdsg" class="reversefootnote">↩</a></p></li><li id="fn:jb-interview"><p><a href="http://www.transadvocate.com/gender-performance-the-transadvocate-interviews-judith-butler_n_13652.htm">Gender Performance: The TransAdvocate interviews Judith Butler</a> <a href="#fnref:jb-interview" class="reversefootnote">↩</a></p></li><li id="fn:rape-fantasies"><p>According to a meta-review of 20 studies. <a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00224490701808191">Women’s Erotic Rape Fantasies: An Evaluation of Theory and Research</a>. <a href="#fnref:rape-fantasies" class="reversefootnote">↩</a></p></li><li id="fn:mim-theory"><p><a href="http://www.prisoncensorship.info/archive/books/mt/mt2_3.pdf">MIM Theory 2/3 – Gender and Revolutionary Feminism</a>. <a href="#fnref:mim-theory" class="reversefootnote">↩</a></p></li></ol></div></main><hr/><nav class="text-center"><ul class="pagination"><li><a href="/capitalism/2014/09/29/how-much-of-world-labour-is-performed-by-women/" title="Prev Post: How Much of the Labour in the World is Performed by Women?">← Prev</a></li><li><a href="/pages/articles/" title="Post Archives">☰</a></li><li class="disabled"><a>Next →</a></li></ul> </nav></div> <script src="/js/scripts.js"></script><script data-no-instant src="/js/instantclick.js"></script><script data-no-instant>!function(n,e,a,t,c,o,i){n.GoogleAnalyticsObject=c,n[c]=n[c]||function(){(n[c].q=n[c].q||[]).push(arguments)},n[c].l=1*new Date,o=e.createElement(a),i=e.getElementsByTagName(a)[0],o.async=1,o.src=t,i.parentNode.insertBefore(o,i)}(window,document,"script","//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js","ga"),ga("create","UA-42712505-1","alyx.io"),InstantClick.on("change",function(){ga("send","pageview",location.pathname+location.search)}),InstantClick.init()</script><script>addAnchors()</script></body></html>
