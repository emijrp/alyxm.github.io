	<p>Communists say that gender is an imminent reality today due to class society. Gender is fundamentally and irrevocably a hierarchy of oppression, exploitation, and domination. The genesis of gender is in the genesis of oppression and exploitation, and the exodus of gender is in the exodus of oppression and exploitation. Gender is thus is an artifact of a particular stage of society, and has not always existed, just as assuredly as oppression and exploitation has not always existed.</p>

<p>On the other hand it is common in liberal circles, and even in some supposedly radical circles who feign a claim to “materialism”, for gender to be thought of not as fundamentally oppressive, but as something that has been “distorted” away from its “true nature” by current society and made “partly oppressive”. To accept this proposition, one <em>must</em> also think gender to be a Natural Law of humynity because there is no other way to explain the existence of gender in a manner that’s logically consistent with the initial proposition.</p>

<p>The proposition that gender isn’t fundamentally oppressive cannot be reconciled with the proposition of the impermanence of gender since there is no sensible explanation for why gender was initially produced, and why it is now continually reproduced, without making reference to class society: something we must abolish. If gender has always existed then it has made witness to all make and manner of society – from a world of primitive communist classlessness to a world beset by parasitic nations feeding on imperial blood – and so class and gender must possess some level of independence as <em>fundamentally</em> distinct phenomena. If we’re to make some claim to “materialism”, and if we’ve ruled out saying that it’s oppressive productive relations spawning gender as a related oppressive social relation, then what <em>can</em> we point to as causing gender? There’s nothing left that makes even the slightest bit of sense, that’s for sure. The only thing we can do is evade the question and fall back on the proposition of the permanence of gender. We can only say that gender is an ever-present aspect of the humyn condition: that gender is “humyn nature”.</p>

<p>The problem with this is that ideas do not fall from the sky. We have elaborate ideas about <em>why</em> certain persyns should be assigned to particular groups, elaborate ideas about <em>who</em> each of us are in light of our assigned group, elaborate ideas about <em>what</em> these groups are, and elaborate ideas about <em>how</em> society as a whole should be structured in support of the existence of said social stratification. Such ideas about society and their structural expression and reproduction through the arrangement of society don’t just “happen” through coincidence, chance, will, or innateness – except in the eyes of the bankrupt idealist. Social existence breeds social consciousnesses, which breeds social action, which in turn shapes social existence. The only way to break with the view of gender as a characteristic of a historically specific type of society is to break with the dialectical materialist notion of the cycle of <code>material world → ideas → material world</code> and say that elaborate ideas – gender in this case – are something almost “ethereal”; something sitting not as a product of the interaction between our brains, our perceived world, and our actions upon the world, but as something sitting almost on it’s own plane of existence, above material reality. The origin of gender can’t be found in heaven upon high, and neither can it be found innately within us because no one could possibly have an ex-cultural or pre-cultural conception of a cultural construct.</p>

<p>If the philosophical faults of this position aren’t damning enough, consider the impossibility of explaining gender without making reference to gender roles – something any self-respecting feminist aims to abolish. What’s “man” to mean if not the negation of “wimmin”/“gender outlaws” and the oppression thereof? What’s gender then to mean apart from a division of labor and a system for control of sexuality and all that is sexual? Every single notion of genderedness is fundamentally a gender role at heart. How else can gender be expressed and understood? When a frilly dress is “womyn”, that’s a gender role; when a particular body part is “womyn”, that’s a gender role. And likewise, in the reverse: when “womyn” is a frilly dress, that’s a gender role; when “womyn” is a particular body part, that’s a gender role. From whichever way one looks at things, and squirm and wriggle as one might, it’s gender roles all the way down.</p>

<p>To forget all this is to rip the emancipatory potential from feminism. If we’re not to destroy the social group “man”/“male”, and gender as a whole, then patriarchy has won and can only resign ourselves to a “neocolonial” kind of psuedo-“equality” between constructs inseparable from oppression and exploitation. That’s not the kind of world i fight for.</p>
