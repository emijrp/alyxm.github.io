	<p>Communists say that gender is an imminent reality today due to class society. Gender is fundamentally and irrevocably a hierarchy of oppression, exploitation, and domination. The genesis of gender is in the genesis of oppression and exploitation, and the exodus of gender is in the exodus of oppression and exploitation. Gender is thus an artifact of a particular stage of society, and has not always existed, just as assuredly as oppression and exploitation has not always existed. Through revolution and the fight against class society and patriarchy, gender will wither away as part of the transition to communism. While we can look at hormones or dresses in our current patriarchal society and be beset by thoughts of “gender”, in a non-patriarchal society these things will cease to possess any structural meaning and become as irrelevant as attached or detached earlobes are to current society.</p>

<p>On the other hand it is common in liberal circles – and even in some supposedly radical circles who feign a claim to “materialism” – for gender to be thought of not as fundamentally oppressive, but as something that has been “distorted” away from its “true nature” by current society and made “partly oppressive”. To accept this proposition, one <em>must</em> also think gender to be a Natural Law of humynity because there is no other way to explain the existence of gender in a manner that’s logically consistent with the initial proposition.</p>

<p>The proposition that gender isn’t fundamentally oppressive cannot be reconciled with the proposition of the impermanence of gender since there is no sensible explanation for why gender was initially produced, and why it is now continually reproduced, without making reference to class society: something we must abolish. If gender has always existed then it has made witness to all make and manner of society – from a world of primitive communist classlessness to a world beset by parasitic nations feeding on imperial blood – and so class and gender must possess some level of independence as <em>fundamentally</em> discrete phenomena. If some claim to “materialism” is to be made, and if the proposition that oppressive productive relations spawned gender as a related oppressive social relation has been ruled out, then what <em>can</em> be pointed to as the cause of gender? There’s nothing left that makes the slightest sense. The only thing left is to nullify the question in the first place by saying that gender is an ever-present aspect of the humyn condition: that the reactionaries are right and gender is “humyn nature”.</p>

<p>The problem with this is that ideas do not fall from the sky. We have elaborate ideas about <em>why</em> certain persyns should be assigned to particular groups, elaborate ideas about <em>who</em> each of us are in light of our assigned group, elaborate ideas about <em>what</em> these groups are, and elaborate ideas about <em>how</em> society as a whole should be structured in support of the existence of said social stratification. Such ideas about society and their structural expression and reproduction through the arrangement of society don’t just “happen” through coincidence, chance, will, or innateness – except in the eyes of the bankrupt idealist. Social existence breeds social consciousness, which breeds social action, which in turn shapes social existence. The only way to break with the view of gender as a characteristic of a historically specific type of society is to break with the dialectical materialist notion of the cycle of <code>material world → ideas → material world</code> and say that ideas – gender in this case – are something existing not as a product of the interaction between our brains, our perceived world, and our actions upon the world, but as something privileged over material reality. The initial cause of gender can’t be found in heaven upon high as that’s primitive idealism, nor can it be found in our neurology as there’s no difference outside of “the ‘drip, drip, drip’ of gender stereotyping”<sup id="fnref:drip"><a href="#fn:drip" class="footnote">1</a></sup>, and neither can it be found innately within us as no one could possibly have an ex-cultural or pre-cultural conception of a cultural construct. It <em>can</em>, however, be found in the relations of production.<sup id="fnref:engels"><a href="#fn:engels" class="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<p>We must also consider the impossibility of explaining or understanding the genderedness or non-genderedness of something without making reference to gender roles – something any self-respecting feminist aims to aboloish. Again, if we’re to keep with dialectical materialism, then there’s no such thing as a metaphysical “woman” out there that exists apart from humyn activity. Gender, as a social construct, must be determined by something to possess any meaning, and this thing is gender roles. When a frilly dress is “womyn”, that’s a gender role; when a particular body part is “womyn”, that’s a gender role. And it also holds true in the reverse perspective: when “womyn” is a frilly dress, that’s a gender role; when “womyn” is a particular body part, that’s a gender role. From whichever way one looks at things, and squirm and wriggle as one might, it’s gender roles all the way down. So what’s “man” to mean to feminism if not the hierarchical negation of “wimmin”/“gender outlaws” and the oppression thereof? What’s “gender” then mean to feminism apart from a division of labor, and a system for control of sexuality and all that is sexual?</p>

<p>At the most basic political level, to forget or deny all of this is to rip the emancipatory potential from feminism. If we’re not to destroy the social group “man”/“male”, and gender as a whole, then patriarchy has won and we cannot do anything but resign ourselves to a “neocolonial” type of “equality” between constructs inseparable from the very thing we say we’re struggling against: oppression and exploitation. That’s not a kind of world worth fighting for.</p>

<p>So, what is your line? Let us consider the varying definitions of “man”:</p>

<p>First, there’s the blatantly patriarchal position – men are strong bearded lumberjacks; men have a penis because “man” and “male” are the same thing; gender is not inherently oppressive. This can be axiomatically discarded.</p>

<p>Secondly, there’s the “radical feminist” position – “men” are the sex group ‘male’, and this group exerts structural domination over the sex group ‘female’ by creating the gender groups “wimmin” and “men”; men have a penis because only males are made “men” by society; gender is inherently oppressive. This can be discarded for the naturalisation of the category of “sex”, and the failure to explain the trans experience.<sup id="fnref:tpdsg"><a href="#fn:tpdsg" class="footnote">3</a></sup></p>

<p>Thirdly, there’s the “liberal feminist” position – “men” are those who express a “man” identity; men have some divergence in anatomy, and do not have a penis by definition; gender is not inherently oppressive. This can be discarded for the naturalisation of the category of “identity”,<sup id="fnref:eg"><a href="#fn:eg" class="footnote">4</a></sup> and the positioning of gender as an ever-present aspect of “humyn nature”.</p>

<p>And finally, there’s the dialectical materialist position – “men” are the group of persyns positioned as “men” by society, and this group exerts structural domination over those positioned as as “non-men” by society; men have some divergence in anatomy, and do not have a penis by definition; gender is inherently oppressive. This sidesteps the problems of liquidationist liberalism and reactionary ‘radicalism’, and I truly believe it to be the only way forward.</p>
