<main>
	<p>It is common these days, while perhaps at least affirming that “sex” is socially constructed like “gender”, to consider the latter not inherently oppressive because lots of persyns are identifying with the concept. There must be something worth saving, the reasoning goes, for it to be considered an important part of many persyn’s lives.<sup id="fnref:butler"><a href="#fn:butler" class="footnote">1</a></sup> The justification is typically one of being pro-trans, in contrast to the old and anti-trans feminism which would see gender disappear. I contend that this historical development in feminism betrays a profound ciscentricism. The changing theoretical approach to gender in mainstream feminism with the emergence of trans politics perfectly mirrors the ciscentric idea that “only trans persyns identify with gender; cis persyns simply <em>are</em>”. When confronted with trans persyns, the historical oddity of a feminism that suddenly finds a new approach to gender, thinking “look at all these persyns identifying with gender”, must answer the charge that identification with gender (whether by a trans or cis persyn) has been going on for centuries.</p>

<p>Additionally, the notion that gender must be saved from the influences of patriarchy and the struggles of feminism alike, and not abolished in the very same moment and through the very same transformation of society that abolishes patriarchy, relies on many weak propositions.</p>

<p>Firstly among these is that one must think gender to be a ‘Natural Law’ of humynity because there is no other way to explain the existence of gender in a manner that’s logically consistent with the initial proposition. The proposition that gender isn’t fundamentally oppressive cannot be reconciled with the proposition of the impermanence of gender since there is no sensible explanation for why gender was initially produced, and why it is now continually reproduced, without making reference to class society: something we must abolish. If gender has always existed then it has made witness to all make and manner of society – from a world of primitive communist classlessness to a world beset by parasitic nations feeding on imperial blood – and so class and gender must possess some level of independence as <em>fundamentally</em> historically discrete phenomena. If some claim to “materialism” is to be made, and if the proposition that oppressive productive relations spawned gender as a related oppressive social relation has been ruled out, then what <em>can</em> be pointed to as the cause of gender? Or even just the cause of patriarchy? There’s nothing left that makes the slightest sense. The only thing left is to nullify the question in the first place by saying that gender is an ever-present aspect of the humyn condition: that the reactionaries are right and gender is “humyn nature”. Thus the question of whether gender is inherantly oppressive and whether it has always existed are one and the same.</p>

<p>The problem with saying that gender has always existed is that ideas do not fall from the sky. We have elaborate ideas about <em>why</em> certain persyns should be assigned to particular groups, elaborate ideas about <em>who</em> each of us are in light of our assigned group, elaborate ideas about <em>what</em> these groups are, and elaborate ideas about <em>how</em> society as a whole should be structured in support of the existence of said social stratification. Such ideas about society and their structural expression and reproduction through the arrangement of society don’t just “happen” through coincidence, chance, will, or innateness – except in the eyes of the bankrupt idealist. Social existence breeds social consciousness, which breeds social action, which in turn shapes social existence. The only way to break with the view of gender as a characteristic of a historically specific type of society is to break with the dialectical materialist notion of the cycle of <code>material world → ideas → material world</code> and say that ideas – gender in this case – are something existing not as a product of the interaction between our brains, our perceived world, and our actions upon the world, but as something privileged over material reality.</p>

<p>If that wasn’t enough, we can also consider the impossibility of explaining or understanding the genderedness or non-genderedness of something without making reference to gender roles – something any self-respecting feminist aims to abolish.</p>

<p>If one can provide the correct answer as to why and how the concept of “red” or “purple” aquires social meaning, then one can also begin to provide the correct answer as to why and how “womyn” or “man” aquires social meaning. Once the basics of the establishment process of any particular social meaning is understood (apparently an incredibly challenging concept to many!) then the only question remaining is: in creating the social meaning of “womyn” or “man”, how different are these practices to the practices of gender roles? Are they not the same? When the social meaning of “womyn” is created by someone saying that “wimmin are the ones who wears dresses”, then only an anti-feminist would say that is not a gender role, only the most buffuddled failure of a feminist would say that this is not actually the construction of the social meaning of “womyn”, and even the most imaginative of a feminist could not hope to invent a sensible method for the construction of the social meaning of “womyn” outside of the practice of gender roles like this. To reiterate, if we’re to keep with dialectical materialism then there’s no such thing as a metaphysical “womyn” out there that exists apart from the results of humyn activity. Gender, as a social construct, must be determined by social activity to possess any meaning – to even exist at all – and this activity we call the imposition and practice of gender roles. When a frilly dress is “womyn”, that’s a gender role; when a particular body part is “womyn”, that’s a gender role. And it also holds true in the reverse perspective: when “womyn” is a frilly dress, that’s a gender role; when “womyn” is a particular body part, that’s a gender role. From whichever way one looks at things, and squirm and wriggle as one might, it’s gender roles all the way down. So what’s “man” to mean to feminism if not the hierarchical negation of “wimmin”/“gender outlaws” and the oppression thereof? What’s “gender” then mean to feminism apart from a division of labor, and a system for control of sexuality and all that is sexual?</p>

<p>Furthermore, the cause or reason for gender cannot be found in our neurology as there’s no difference outside of “the ‘drip, drip, drip’ of gender stereotyping”.<sup id="fnref:drip"><a href="#fn:drip" class="footnote">2</a></sup> The almost complete absense of any brain differences between the “genders” – with what little difference that does exist being easily explained through the combination of neuroplasticity and patriarchal society – means that gender as a social practice cannot be an inevitable result of a humyn need to express one’s inner, biological or pre-social, inclinations to gender.</p>

<p>So to sum things up, the initial cause of gender also can’t be found in heaven upon high as that’s primitive objective idealism. Nor can gender be found innately within us on an ideological level as that’s primitive subjective idealism and no one could possibly have an ex-cultural or pre-cultural conception of a system of social meaning. Nor can gender be found “biologically”.</p>

<p>Gender <em>can</em>, however, be found in the relations of production.<sup id="fnref:engels"><a href="#fn:engels" class="footnote">3</a></sup> It’s an imminent reality today due to class society; it’s fundamentally and irrevocably a hierarchy of oppression, exploitation, and domination. The genesis of gender is in the genesis of oppression and exploitation, and the exodus of gender is in the exodus of oppression and exploitation. Gender is thus an artifact of a particular stage of society, and has not always existed, just as assuredly as oppression and exploitation has not always existed. Through revolution and the fight against class society and patriarchy, gender will wither away as part of the transition to communism. While we can look at hormones or dresses in our current patriarchal society and be beset by thoughts of “gender”, in a non-patriarchal society these things will cease to possess any structural meaning and become as socially irrelevant as attached or detached earlobes are to our current society.</p>

<p>At the most basic political level, to forget or deny all of this is to rip the emancipatory potential from feminism. If we’re not to destroy the social group “man”/“male”, and gender as a whole, then patriarchy has won and we cannot do anything but resign ourselves to a “neocolonial” type of “equality” between constructs inseparable from the very thing we say we’re struggling against: oppression and exploitation. That’s not a kind of world worth fighting for.</p>

<p>So, what is your line? Let us consider the varying definitions of “man”:</p>

<p>First, there’s the blatantly patriarchal position – men are strong bearded lumberjacks; men have a penis because “man” and “male” are the same thing; gender is not inherently oppressive. This can be axiomatically discarded.</p>

<p>Secondly, there’s the “cis radical feminist” position – “men” are the sex class ‘male’, and this group exerts structural domination over the sex class ‘female’ by creating the gender groups “wimmin” and “men”; men have a penis because only males are made “men” by society; gender is inherently oppressive. This can be discarded for the naturalisation of the category of “sex”, and the failure to explain the trans experience.<sup id="fnref:tpdsg"><a href="#fn:tpdsg" class="footnote">4</a></sup> As MacKinnon said, “Male dominant society has defined women as a discrete biological group forever. If this was going to produce liberation, we’d be free”.<sup id="fnref:mackinnon"><a href="#fn:mackinnon" class="footnote">5</a></sup></p>

<p>Thirdly, there’s the “liberal feminist” position – “men” are those who express a “man” identity; men have some divergence in anatomy, and do not have a penis by definition; gender is not inherently oppressive. This can be discarded for the naturalisation of the category of “identity”,<sup id="fnref:eg"><a href="#fn:eg" class="footnote">6</a></sup> and the positioning of gender as an ever-present aspect of “humyn nature”.</p>

<p>And finally, there’s the dialectical materialist position – “men” are the group of persyns positioned as “men” by society, and this group exerts structural domination over those positioned as as “non-men” by society; men have some divergence in anatomy, and do not have a penis by definition; gender is inherently oppressive. This sidesteps the problems of liquidationist liberalism and reactionary ‘radicalism’, and I truly believe it to be the only way forward.</p>

<p>There is no need to sacrifice our feminism on the altar of identity or biology.</p>
