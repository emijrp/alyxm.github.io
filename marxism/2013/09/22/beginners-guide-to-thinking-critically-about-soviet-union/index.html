In 1926 80% of the population was in the agricultural sector.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup> The Soviet Union had to industrialise and modernise fast, or die. Everything else being the same, a capitalist state in that situation would have inevitably fallen. Only the strength of the socialist system – the rational organisation of the economy, not the anarchy of the “free” market – could trudge through that, and ultimately uplift the soviet people from peasants to cosmonauts in 40 years.</p><p>Direct comparisons of the economies of Marxist states to the economies of the USA, Japan, and the rich <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_democracy#Dictatorship_of_the_bourgeoisie">bourgeois-democracies</a> of Europe can’t be made. So far all proletarian revolutions have happened in thoroughly exploited and economically backward countries. The USSR was not built on the back of slave labour, colonialism, and imperialism, unlike the first world. Things like food security, healthcare, and general wellbeing of the people were far below the level of the first world at the time of the revolution.</p><h3 id="revolution">Revolution</h3><p>A revolution isn’t a sterile, perfectly replicable and controllable laboratory affair. It’s a diabolically messy endeavour to destroy and recreate every single bond of society, one involving millions of influences, factors, and people from around the world.</p><p>The science of revolution was in its infancy at the time of the founding of the Soviet Union. From the methods of establishing <a href="http://www.marxists.org/glossary/terms/p/r.htm#proletariat">proletarian</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_hegemony">hegemony</a> to the day-to-day running of a post-revolution socialist state, the water laid predominantly unrippled by historical knowledge. The Soviet Union did not have the benefit of past insight and experiences. They were heroically (and necessarily) charging forward into the unknown.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote">3</a></sup> Mistakes were inevitable, but necessary.</p><p>Marxism is a living, breathing, science, and with the insights gained from past revolutionary experience it has progressed as a science. <a href="http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/mao/selected-works/volume-1/mswv1_16.htm">Practice is the basis of knowlege</a> in the final instance, and getting things <em>completely</em> right the first time is an unrealistic expectation.</p><h3 id="violence">Violence</h3><blockquote><p>A revolution is not a dinner party, or writing an essay, or painting a picture, or doing embroidery: it cannot be so refined, so leisurely and gentle, so temporate, kind, courteous, restrained and magnanimous. A revolution is an insurrection, an act of violence by which one class overthrows another. <small>“Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan” (March 1927), Mao Tse-tung</small></p></blockquote><p>A revolution of any nature, progressive, regressive or a mixture thereof, requires violence. The ruling class has never, and will never, permit a radical restructuring of society without death and destruction. As unfortunate as it may be, the same applies to the modern-day ruling class – the bourgeoisie – a class which from the outset set the stage with the violent repression and exploitation of the proletariat. Only violence of a progressive (and self-defensive) nature – violence with the aim of stopping future class-based violence – can wrest control of society from the regressive violence of the bourgeoisie.</p><p>As Stalin said to HG Wells in the famous interview:<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote">4</a></sup></p><blockquote><p><strong>Stalin:</strong> The Communists base themselves on rich historical experience which teaches that obsolete classes do not voluntarily abandon the stage of history.</p><p>Recall the history of England in the seventeenth century. Did not many say that the old social system had decayed? But did it not, nevertheless, require a Cromwell to crush it by force?</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>Wells:</strong> Cromwell acted on the basis of the constitution and in the name of constitutional order.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>Stalin:</strong> In the name of the constitution he resorted to violence, beheaded the king, dispersed Parliament, arrested some and beheaded others!</p><p>Or take an example from our history. Was it not clear for a long time that the Tsarist system was decaying, was breaking down? But how much blood had to be shed in order to overthrow it?</p><p>And what about the October Revolution? Were there not plenty of people who knew that we alone, the Bolsheviks, were indicating the only correct way out? Was it not clear that Russian capitalism had decayed? But you know how great was the resistance, how much blood had to be shed in order to defend the October Revolution from all its enemies.</p><p>Or take France at the end of the eighteenth century. Long before 1789 it was clear to many how rotten the royal power, the feudal system, was. But a popular insurrection, a clash of classes was not, could not be avoided. Why? Because the classes which must abandon the stage of history are the last to become convinced that their role is ended. It is impossible to convince them of this. They think that the fissures in the decaying edifice of the old order can be repaired and saved.</p><p>That is why dying classes take to arms and resort to every means to save their existence as a ruling class.</p><p>[…]</p><p>The rich experience of history teaches that up to now not a single class has voluntarily made way for another class. There is no such precedent in history. The Communists have learned this lesson of history. Communists would welcome the voluntary departure of the bourgeoisie. But such a turn of affairs is improbable, that is what experience teaches. That is why the Communists want to be prepared for the worst and call upon the working class to be vigilant, to be prepared for battle.</p></blockquote><p>Endless pacifistic moralising over violence employed in proletarian self-defense normally belongs firmly in the realm of people who live at the centres of capitalism and who benefit from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superprofit#Leninist_interpretation">super-profits</a> and the accompanying super-exploitation of the populous of the periphery by imperialism. It’s easy to condemn violence when you’re not facing, and in fact benefit, from the oppression that spawned it.</p><p>Be wary of projecting modern-day values, expectations, and morality into the past. Don’t fall for presentism. It’s important to judge historical entities both in light of the society that birthed them <em>and</em> through our modern-day lens. People of any kind of political affiliation, communist or capitalist, were more violent back then.</p><h3 id="propaganda">Propaganda</h3><p>In every epoch the ideas of the ruling class become “common sense”. From the “divine right of rule” of monarchism, and the “great chain of beings” of feudalism, to the “human nature” of capitalism, these values are projected eternal, backwards and forwards into time.</p><p>Given the legacy of the Red Scare, McCarthyism and the Cold War, and given that Marxism is rigorously opposed to class society it’s no surprise that anti-Marxism, the evils of Joseph ‘literally hitler’ Stalin, and the “brutal nature” of the Soviet Union join “human nature” in the heavenly halls “common sense”. Brutal bourgeois class rule is so utterly normalised by the culture industry, our reference points and points of comparison are so utterly distorted in favor of capitalist morality, that anything to dare challenge it is immediately and uncritically discarded.</p><p>Listening to most petty-bourgeois historians on the question of communism is akin to listening to MRA hate screed about feminism. They’ve picked their side and through a combination of their social consciousness (brought about by their social existence) and dogmatism they’ll invent innumerable distortions to justify it. Even within the privileged circles of academia (a group pretty high up in the “most predisposed to bourgeois ideals” list) there exists a not insignificant number who dispute the outrageously ahistorical cold-war-era claims of some of their peers. Ludo Martens, J. Arch Getty, and Grover Furr, to name but a few. Not all of them are even marxists.</p><h3 id="successes">Successes</h3><p>People are always quick to point out the the failures of the USSR, but what about the successes? The USSR created the most equal large-scale society since class-society became dominant:</p><blockquote><p>Heroic attempts were made in Russia to build a new society of freedom after the revolution. Homosexuality was decriminalized, and abortion was also legalized (<em>Author note: though later <a href="http://marxism-leninism-maoism.tumblr.com/post/89440209448/i-hear-people-say-that-stalin-was-a-misogynist-do-you">recriminalised</a> in Stalin’s period, it was not for quite so blatantly patriarchal a reason as one might expect</em>). Laws denying recognition of children born out of wedlock were wiped away. The Bolshevik government established communal laundries, kindergartens, nurseries, and kitchens. Special efforts were made to provide literacy and education, especially to women. “Not a single bourgeois republic,” said Lenin, “had done in decades so much as a hundredth part of what we did [for women] in our first year in power”. Lenin believed that it was impossible to talk of real communism until women had been completely emancipated. <small>The Meaning of Marxism, Paul D’Amato</small></p></blockquote><p>A few highlights of the <a href="http://www.departments.bucknell.edu/russian/const/36cons04.html">1936 constitution</a>:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Article 122</strong>. Women in the U.S.S.R. are accorded equal rights with men in all spheres of economic, state, cultural, social and political life. The possibility of exercising these rights is ensured to women by granting them an equal right with men to work, payment for work, rest and leisure, social insurance and education, and by state protection of the interests of mother and child, prematernity and maternity leave with full pay, and the provision of a wide network of maternity homes, nurseries and kindergartens.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>Article 123</strong>. Equality of rights of citizens of the U.S.S.R., irrespective of their nationality or race, in all spheres of economic, state, cultural, social and political life, is an indefeasible law. Any direct or indirect restriction of the rights of, or, conversely, any establishment of direct or indirect privileges for, citizens on account of their race or nationality, as well as any advocacy of racial or national exclusiveness or hatred and contempt, is punishable by law.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>Article 135</strong>. Elections of deputies are universal: all citizens of the U.S.S.R. who have reached the age of eighteen, irrespective of race or nationality, religion, educational and residential qualifications, social origin, property status or past activities, have the right to vote in the election of deputies and to be elected, with the exception of insane persons and persons who have been convicted by a court of law and whose sentences include deprivation of electoral rights.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>Article 137</strong>. Women have the right to elect and be elected on equal terms with men.</p></blockquote><p>Before the “progressive” European “democracies” France, Italy, Switzerland, and Liechtenstein (and many others around the globe) <em>even gave women the right to vote</em>, the USSR was establishing laws for equal pay for equal work, maternity leave with full pay, the provision of free childcare, abolishing the distinction between “legitimate” and “illegitimate” children, and so on.</p><p>The USSR established the first totally free and universal education system and the first totally free and universal healthcare system. The USSR was the first country to acheive a 0% unemployment rate, one of the early ones to adopt women’s suffrage and anti-racism laws, the first to legalise abortion, and the first to have a woman hold a position in government (Alexandra Kolontai).</p><p>Although things were not completely equal in the USSR, and we can provide many deserved criticisms of it now, placing in its historical context and comparing it to the capitalist regimes around the world at that time, the acheivements were tremendous. They set an example that astounded the world, and provided a rallying point for feminists around the globe.</p><h3 id="failure">Failure</h3><p>The ultimate failure of the Soviet Union doesn’t necessarily imply a fundamental theoretical inadequacy. Sometimes the forces of the world at a particular point in time wouldn’t allow for ultimate success even with the most astute of theoretical insights and a “flawless” revolution. Before pointing a finger at socialism for failing, and a smile at capitalism for winning, it is useful to take a look at capitalism and how much easier its battle with feudalism was compared to the battle socialism must fight to depose capitalism.</p><p>Capitalism needs to dominate the world, it must always expand and open up new markets. It must monopolise and appropriate. Fuedalism doesn’t need to do this, a fuedal state can relatively happily co-exist with a capitalist state. A capitalist state, however, cannot happily co-exist with a feudal state, and it most certainly cannot co-exist with a proletarian state.</p><p>The bourgeois had huge innovations in both the methods and relations of production to help them gain supremacy over the aristocracy. Under fuedalism families would live and work on their own small-scale farms, and produce the goods they needed themselves on a piece-by-piece basis for their own private consumption. The advanced division, specialization, and concentration of labour that capitalism brought about, with the consequential technological innovations that allowed for, was a colossal leap over the type of labour dominant under fuedalism.</p><p>Production under socialism is of course better than under capitalism, but it is mostly an innovation in the relations of production alone (and a relatively small one at that), and thus does not constitute an absolutely colossal leap as was seen from feudalism to capitalism, which helped the bourgeois immensely.</p><p>But even so, it’s not like bourgeois history isn’t mired with failures. Most of the bourgeois revolutions that swept Europe in 1848 failed, the Commonwealth of England failed, the Italian city-states failed. Even the major and long-lasting present-day bourgeois states have only “succeeded” insofar as they can can be said to have succeeded in “exiting up until the present day”. They haven’t succeeded in providing the liberal promise of “liberté, égalité, fraternité”.</p><p>Bourgeois revolutions were driven by objective and subjective motors, but the subjective factor dominates proletarian revolutions. Socialism is very much a conscious movement to abolish the current state of things.</p><p>The outright failures of many of the bourgeois states littered throughout history and the not-so-outright failures of the current bourgeois states get swept under the rug ever since feudalism was deposed for good. The bourgeois political project has “died” and become normalised since it became the dominant mode of production. Socialism, however, continues to be a living political project and it will have to answer to every single one of its failures up until the time that capitalism is no more and the very last of the expropriators are overthrown by the very last of the expropriated.</p><hr/><h3 id="further-reading">Further Reading</h3><h4 id="general">101/General</h4><ul><li><a href="/images/2013-09-22-beginners-guide-to-thinking-critically-about-soviet-union/how-communism-works.jpg"><del>How Communism Works</del></a></li><li><a href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1847/11/prin-com.htm">The Principles of Communism</a></li><li><a href="http://www.bannedthought.net/India/PeoplesMarch/PM1999-2006/publications/mlm/contents.htm">Marxism-Leninism-Maoism Introduction</a></li></ul><h4 id="ussr">USSR</h4><ul><li><a href="http://www.marxists.org/history/erol/ncm-5/bacu-2/resolution5.htm">The Restoration of Capitalism in the Soviet Union</a></li><li><a href="http://www.northstarcompass.org/nsc9912/lies.htm">Lies Concerning the History of the Soviet Union</a></li><li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130830170745/http://weeklybolshevik.wordpress.com/2013/07/29/on-the-deaths-in-stalins-ussr/">On the deaths in Stalin’s USSR</a></li></ul><h4 id="violence-1">Violence</h4><ul><li><a href="http://freespace.virgin.net/pep.talk/Violence.htm">On The Necessity Of Revolutionary Violence</a></li><li><a href="http://moufawad-paul.blogspot.co.uk/2012/06/normative-pacifism-and-necessity-of.html?view=classic">Normative Pacifism and the Necessity of Violence</a></li><li><a href="http://moufawad-paul.blogspot.co.uk/2010/11/question-of-comparative-violence.html?view=classic">The Question of Comparative Violence</a></li></ul><p>You can find more at <a href="/educational-resources/class/">alyx.io - Educational Resources: Class</a>.</p><hr/><div class="footnotes"><ol><li id="fn:1"><p>I say “pre-Khrushchev” as the time roughly from around the death of Stalin to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sino-Soviet_split">Sino-Soviet Split</a> marks the begining of dominant USSR <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revisionism_%28Marxism%29">revisionism</a>. <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote">↩</a></p></li><li id="fn:2"><p><a href="http://www.marxists.org/history/ussr/government/1928/sufds/ch17.htm">Soviet Union Information Bureau: The Soviet Union: Facts, Descriptions, Statistics, Chapter 17 – Labour</a> <a href="#fnref:2" class="reversefootnote">↩</a></p></li><li id="fn:3"><p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Commune">Paris Commune</a> involved roughly 2 million people and only existed for a few months before it was crushed.
